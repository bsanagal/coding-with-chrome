Coding with Chrome is an Educational Development Environment built around two
core philosophies:
  1. Offer a stand-alone, offline app experience which allows people anywhere to
learn how to build useful computer programs:
    * A basic IDE able to support real programming work
    * A tutorial system that poses a challenge, checks the solution and
      provides feedback.

  2. Allow educators to put together a custom curriculum made up of various
components like:
    * input languages (blockly, javascript, coffeescript)
    * output modules (turtle graphics, javascript output, connected robots)
    * Flexible UI where elements can be easily added, modified or removed
    * Tutorial engine for self learning

## How to build your own Coding with Chrome App

### Get the sources
Download the source files manual from GitHub or with git by running:
```bash
git clone git://github.com/google/coding-with-chrome.git
```

### Get required packages
Enter the "coding-with-chrome" directory and get the required packages by:
```bash
npm install
```

### Build and run the actual app
To compile and run the Chrome app use the following command:
```bash
npm run fast-build
```
This will automatically build and start the application on Mac OS, Linux or
Windows.


### Build the actual app
To compile the Chrome app run the build script:

select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).

Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.

### Add the app
On the same page click `Load unpacked extension…` to pop up a file-selection
dialog.

Navigate to the directory in which your `genfiles/` files live, and select it.

Alternatively, you can drag and drop the directory where your `genfiles/` files
live onto chrome://extensions in your browser to load it.

### Launch the app

### Rebuild the app
If you change something in the source code, you will need to re-compile it by:
```bash
npm run rebuild
```
After this you only need to reload the Chrome App to see your change in action.

### Update dependencies
Run the following command to update the dependencies to the latest version:
```bash
npm run update

### Translation
If you want to help with the translation perform the following steps:
* Navigate around in the UI part you want to translate
* Open the Chrome Developer Tools inside the Coding with Chrome App
* Type the following command into the console:
```javascript
i18n.getToDo()
```
This will return a list of all untranslated text for your language.
Add your translations to the output and place them into the file
 `app/_locales/[language]/message.json`.

### Google Drive support (experimental)
To enable the experimental Google Drive support add your application key and
your api key to the `app/manifest.json` file:
```json
…
